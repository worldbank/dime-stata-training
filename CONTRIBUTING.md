# How to contribute (No GitHub knowledge required):

## Feature request, bug reports and general comments

An easy but very helpful way to provide feedback on this resource is to create an 
[issue]([https://github.com/worldbank/dime-stata-training/issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues)) in GitHub. 
You can read issues submitted by other users or create a new issue [here](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-stata-training/issues). 
While the word issue has a negative connotation outside GitHub, a GitHub-issue can be used for any kind of feedback. 
Even a question on how to use the resource.

If you have suggestions of content additions, or think any part of this training is not clear, 
creating an issue is a great tool for suggesting that. 
Please read already existing issues to check whether someone else has made the same suggestion or reported the same error before creating a new issue. 
You can use the search bar in case the number of issues is large.

## How to contribute using Github:

### Opening and organizing a new issue
1. Open issues for all edits you make that are not trivial, such as typos in text etc.
1. Assign this issue to yourself or someone else, or let someone else assign themselves.

### Working on a solution to an issue
1. Assign yourself if you have not already done so. 
2. Unless the solution is simple, create a new branch from the develop branch and name it after the issue. 
Include the issue number and a word or two describing the issue. 
(If the solution is simple then make your change directly to the `develop` branch and skip to step 7 when you are done.) 
For example - if you're working on issue 20 and fixing the margins in the document, name the branch *issue-20-fixing the margins*.
3. If you at any point need help with the solution, ask for that in the comment thread for this issue. 
4. When you are done, create a pull request from your branch to the develop branch. Admin will then review the pull request. 
The issue will be closed when its solution is merged into the `main` branch.
